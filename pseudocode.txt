#This is the pseudocode for the plant watering project!


#the following method is the starting place for the program.
Begin/Reset:
	set the dryness threshold (depends upon plant)
	set the light to daytime
	set the daytime counter to 12h
	set the watering delay counter to (differs per plant)
	go to Moisture_Check


#the following method determines if the plant needs to be watered.
Moisture_Check:
	Read the moisture sensor (get value)
	If the retrieved moisture value is greater than the dryness threshold (if wet):
		go to Daytime_Check
	Else (if its dry):
		If the water delay counter > 0 (still need to wait to water):
			go to Daytime_Check
		Else (its time to water)
			go to Water_da_plant
			
	
#the following method checks the daytime counter in order to control if the plant is being lit or not.	
Daytime_Check:
	If the daytime counter is 0 (it has been 12h):
		Set light to opposite state
		Reset the daytime_counter
		go to Moisture Check
	Else (if it has not been 12 hours yet):
		decrement daytime counter by approximate time taken to implement state machine
		go to Moisture Check


#The following method waters the plant!
Water_da_plant:
	actuate the valve for certain amount of time (based on plant size)
	reset the watering delay counter
	go to Moisture_Check
